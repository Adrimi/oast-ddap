# OAST Project 2

The project aims to solve DAP and DDAP with use of evolutionary algorithm.

## How to (on Linux/macOS)

To properly launch the files you need to:

1. Open project directory in CLI
2. Execute following command:

```sh
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:`pwd`"
```

3. Then you can run the project, with (for e.g.):

```sh
python3 main.py
```

As long as you dont close the CLI you are fine. When you close it, then you need to repeat step 1. and 2. again :)
